# Word Scramble

This is a simple word scramble game built with AngularJS. Words are grabbed from the Wordnik API.

Possible improvements:
* A more refined scoring system
** Maybe add some multipliers based on word difficulty
* Difficulty levels
** This can be achieved via a combination of the corpus frequency and word size parameters in the Wordnik API
* Leaderboards
* A versus mode
** Maybe use websockets
* Mobile/tablet support
* Add unit tests
