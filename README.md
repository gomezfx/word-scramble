# Word Scramble

This is a simple word scramble game built with AngularJS. Words are grabbed from the Wordnik API and you have 60 seconds to unscramble as many words as possible. There is also a simple scoring system in place.

Possible improvements:
* A more refined scoring system
  * Maybe add some multipliers based on word difficulty
* Difficulty levels
  * This can be achieved via a combination of the corpus frequency and word size parameters in the Wordnik API
* Leaderboards
* A versus mode
  * Maybe use websockets
* Mobile/tablet support
* Add unit tests
